# onos-kpimon
The xApplication for ONOS SD-RAN (ÂµONOS Architecture) to monitor KPI

## Overview
The `onos-kpimon` is the xApplication running over ONOS SD-RAN to monitor the KPI.
`onos-kpimon` collects KPIs reported by E2 nodes through the KPM service model version 2.0.
Since ONOS SD-RAN has multiple micro-services running on the Kubernetes platform, `onos-kpimon` should run on the Kubernetes along with the other ONOS SD-RAN micro-services.
In order to deploy `onos-kpimon` on the Kubernetes, a Helm chart is necessary, which is in the `sdran-helm-charts` repository.
Note that this application should be running together with the other SD-RAN micro-services, such as `Atomix`, `onos-operator`, `onos-e2t`, `onos-uenib`, `onos-topo`, and `onos-cli`).
Easily, `sd-ran` umbrella chart can be used to deploy all essential micro-services and `onos-kpimon`.

## Interaction with the other ONOS SD-RAN micro-services
To begin with, `onos-kpimon` makes a subscription with E2 nodes connected to `onos-e2t` through `onos-topo` based ONOS xApplication SDK.
Creating a subscription, `onos-kpimon` sets `report interval` and `granularity period` which are the monitoring interval parameters.
Once the subscription is done successfully, each E2 node starts sending indication messages periodically to report KPIs to `onos-kpimon`.
Then, `onos-kpimon` decodes each indication message that has KPI monitoring reports and store them to both KPIMON local store, or `onos-uenib`.
A user can check the stored monitoring results through `onos-cli` as below.
Also, if Prometheus and Grafana are enabled, the user can see the stored monitoring results through Grafana dashboard or Prometheus web GUI.

## Command Line Interface
Go to the `onos-cli`, and command below:
```bash
$ onos kpimon list metrics
